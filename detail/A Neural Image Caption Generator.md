## Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator

### 1.What is this paper about?

Generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation and that can be used to generate natural sentences describing an image.

### 2.What’s better than previous paper?

previous one is mainly that an “encoder” RNN reads the source sentence and transforms it into a rich fixed-length vector representation, which in turn in used as the initial hidden state of a “decoder” RNN that generates the target sentence.

This paper propse replacing the encoder RNN by a deep convolution neural network (CNN).

### 3.What are important parts of technique and methods?



### 4.How did they verify it?



### 5.Is there a debate?
