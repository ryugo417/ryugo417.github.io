## ManiGAN: Text-Guided Image Manipulation

### 1.What is this paper about?

It proposes a novel generative adversarial network (ManiGAN), which contains two key components: text-image affine combination module (ACM) and detail correction module (DCM). 

### 2.Whatâ€™s better than previous paper?

It overperform previouse method as bellow.
