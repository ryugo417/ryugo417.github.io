## Controllable Text-to-Image Generation

### 1.What is this paper about?

It proposes a novel model that, given a source image and a target text description, satisfies the requirements of being realistic image while conforming to the target text description, and maintaining the features of the source image in regions that are unrelated to the target text description.

### 2.Whatâ€™s better than previous paper?

It is the first model to generate an image that matches the target description under the situation where the images is given.

### 3.What are important parts of technique and methods?

The key is to learn the shared representation of two modalities (e.g. image and text). 

### 4.How did they verify it?
