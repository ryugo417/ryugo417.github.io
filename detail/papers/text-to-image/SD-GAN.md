## DM-GAN: Dynamic Memory Generative Adversarial Networks for Text-to-Image Synthesis

### 1.What is this paper about?

It proposes Semantics Disentangling Generative Adversarial Network(SD-GAN) that implicitly disentangles semantics to both fulfill the high-level semantic consistency and low-level semantic diversity.

### 2.Whatâ€™s better than previous paper?

The previous model lacked the ability to generate similar images from two texts describing the same ground-truth.
To address this issue, it can generate consistency image in spilte of retainning semantic diversities and details.

### 3.What are important parts of technique and methods?

- Siamese Structure with Contrastive Losses


### 4.How did they verify it?
