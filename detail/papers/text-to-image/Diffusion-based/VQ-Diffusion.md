## Vector Quantized Diffusion Model for Text-to-Image Synthesis
### 1.What is this paper about?

It proposes the Vector Quantized Diffuison model for text-to-image generation, based on VQ-VAE.
This is one of the method to use denoising Diffusion Probabilostic Model(DDPM).
It can handle more complex scenes and improve the synthesized image quality by a large margin.

### 2.Whatâ€™s better than previous paper?

Previus model(VQ-VAE) has two problems.
1. the unsirectional bias which causes the reading order from top-left to bottom right, to predict pixels or tokens
1. th accumulated prediction errors which causes there is no ground-truth image different from training phase.

### 3.What are important parts of technique and methods?



### 4.How did they verify it?



### 5.Is there a debate?



### 6.What paper should I read next?
